# instagram_bot  
  
## Presentation  
  
A prototype of **instagram bot** using my [webdriver library](https://github.com/Mubelotix/webdriver).  
**You need** to launch selenium (included in repository) before launch the program. This is a java file and you need to install jre to run it (sorry).  
Firefox does not work for now because we are affected by a bug.  
You may have to update the driver of your browser (chromedriver and geckodriver files) to match with the version of it.  

## How to run
  
Run selenium with :  
  
```
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar
```
  
and then compile and launch with :  
  
```
cargo run
```
